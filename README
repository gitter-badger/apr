Apache Portable Runtime Library (APR)
-------------------------------------

   The Apache Portable Runtime Library provides a predictable and
   consistent interface to underlying platform-specific
   implementations, with an API to which software developers may code
   and be assured of predictable if not identical behavior regardless
   of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of
   the need to code special-case conditions to work around or take
   advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.

   APR and its companion libraries are implemented entirely in C
   and provide a common programming interface across a wide variety
   of operating system platforms without sacrificing performance.
   Currently supported platforms include:

     UNIX variants
     Windows
     Netware
     Mac OS X
     OS/2

   To give a brief overview, the primary core
   subsystems of APR 1.3 include the following:

     Atomic operations
     Dynamic Shared Object loading
     File I/O
     Locks (mutexes, condition variables, etc)
     Memory management (high performance allocators)
     Memory-mapped files
     Multicast Sockets
     Network I/O
     Shared memory
     Thread and Process management
     Various data structures (tables, hashes, priority queues, etc)

   Users of APR 0.9 should be aware that migrating to the APR 1.x
   programming interfaces may require some adjustments; APR 1.x is
   neither source nor binary compatible with earlier APR 0.9 releases.
   Users of APR 1.x can expect consistent interfaces and binary backwards
   compatibility throughout the entire APR 1.x release cycle, as defined
   in our versioning rules:

     http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html

   APR is already used extensively by the Apache HTTP Server
   version 2 and the Subversion revision control system, to
   name but a few.  We list all known projects using APR at
   http://apr.apache.org/projects.html -- so please let us know
   if you find our libraries useful in your own projects!
